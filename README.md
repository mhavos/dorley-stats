### breakdown of word count by speaker and narrator
for speaker any text produced in-universe by the character is counted. this includes direct speech, text messages, and written notes.

for narrator any text included in their pov segment counts, as long as it is not included in the previous category.

### cumulative word count by in-universe time
this counts all words up until a given in-universe time. the steeper the line at any given point, the more written about that time, per time unit.

this chart contains three sub-charts:
1. the first chart shows the entire work.
2. the second chart shows any text written about time before Steph is kidnapped (character retrospective).
3. the third chart shows any text written about time after Steph is kidnapped (chronological events).
